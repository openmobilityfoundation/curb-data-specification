# Curb Data Specification: Events API

<a href="/events/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hC8py0L.png" width="100" align="right" alt="CDS Events Icon" border="0"></a>

The Events API is a REST API allowing real-time and historic events at the curb to be sent to cities, and the ability to check on the status of any sensors. Events can come from company data feeds, on street sensors, session payments, company check-ins, in-person parking personnel, and/or other city data sources. Data sent in the Events API can be connected to the Curbs API over time and space, and events are used for calculations in the Metrics API. 

**See [other CDS APIs](/README.md#curb-data-specification-apis) on the homepage.**

# Endpoints

There are two different endpoints that are part of the Events API:

  - A [Curb Event](#curb-event) is an activity that occurs near, at, or within a pre-defined curb area. Defining events is *required* as part of the Events API.
  - A [Status](#status) is the current status of a curb monitoring source. Event status is *optional*.

**See [examples](examples.md) for these endpoints.**

# Data Objects 

## Curb Event

A Curb Event is a record of activity that happens within the geographic bounds of a Curbs object. 

A Curb Event is represented as a JSON object, whose fields are as follows:

| Name   | Type   | Required/Optional   | Description   |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| `event_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Required | The globally unique identifier of the event that occurred. |
| `event_type` | [Event Type](#event-type) | Required | The event_type that happened for this event. |
| `event_purpose` | [Event Purpose](#event-purpose) | Conditionally Required | General curb usage purpose that the vehicle performed during the event. Required for sources capable of determining activity type for relevant event_types. |
| `event_location` | [GeoJSON](/general-information.md#geographic-telemetry-data) | Required | The geographic point location where the event occurred. |
| `event_time` | [Timestamp][ts] | Required | Time at which the event occurred. |
| `event_publication_time` | [Timestamp][ts] | Required | Time at which the event became available for consumption by this API. |
| `event_session_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Optional | May be provided to tie known connected `park_start` and `park_end` event types together by a unique session ID. If _not_ confident of being able to determine a `park_end` event at some time after `park_start` is recorded (i.e., you cannot detect when a vehicle departs), then do _not_ use session_id. This field may be most useful to payment companies who provide their source data as sessions (typical for transaction data). _Note also_: the use of the term "session" across CDS means the start and end of curb usage of a vehicle, not necessarily a financial or payment session or transaction. |
| `curb_zone_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Conditionally Required | Unique ID of the Curb Zone where the event occurred. Required for events that occurred at a known Curb Zone for ALL _event_types_. |
| `curb_area_ids` | Array of [UUID][uuid] | Conditionally Required | Unique IDs of the Curb Area where the event occurred. Since Curb Areas can overlap, an event may happen in more than one. Required for events that occurred in a known Curb Area, if known and used, for these event_types: _enter_area, exit_area, park_start, park_end_ |
| `curb_space_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Conditionally Required | Unique ID of the Curb Space where the event occurred. Required for events that occurred at a known Curb Space, if known and used, for these event_types: _park_start, park_end, enter_area, exit_area_ |
| `curb_object_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Conditionally Required | Unique ID of the Curb Object where the event occurred. Required for events that occurred at a known Curb Object, if known and used, for these event_types: _park_start, park_end, enter_area, exit_area_ |
| `data_source_type` | Enum [Source Type](#source-type) | Required | General category of the source creating the event. |
| `data_source_operator_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Conditionally Required | Unique identifier of the entity responsible for operating the event data source. IDs can identify the fleet operator sending a data feed, or the organization (company or city) operating the sensor. IDs for fleet operators are required and global and come from the [data_source_operators.csv](/data_source_operators.csv) file, and optional for others. Read our [How to Get a Data Source Operator ID](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/curb-data-specification/wiki/Adding-a-CDS-Data-Source-Operator-ID) guide. An agency at their discretion may allow a small, local company to simply provide a consistent `data_source_operator_name` string instead of this field, otherwise this field is required. |
| `data_source_operator_name` | String | Optional | Name of the provider responsible for operating the vehicle, device, or sensor at the time of the event. May be sent along with `data_source_operator_id` or on its own for small operators at the discretion of the city. |
| `data_source_device_id` | [UUID][uuid] | Required | Unique identifier of this event source, whether sensor, vehicle, camera, etc. Allows agencies to connect related Events as they are recorded by the same source. If coming from a provider, this is a generated UUID they use and not the same as the external `vehicle_id`. If this field is needed for your use cases, review our [Privacy Guidance](/README.md#data-privacy). |
| `data_source_device_name` | String | Conditionally Required | Unique name of this event source, whether sensor, vehicle, camera, etc. Allows agencies to connect related Events as they are recorded by the same source. If coming from a provider, this is usually the internal ID they use for the device. Must be provided if the device has a visible or shared identifier. If this field is needed for your use cases, review our [Privacy Guidance](/README.md#data-privacy). |
| `data_source_manufacturer` | String | Optional | Manufacturer of the data source hardware or vehicle reporting event data. |
| `data_source_model` | String | Optional | Model of the data source hardware or vehicle reporting event data. |
| `sensor_status_is_commissioned` | Boolean | Optional | If a sensor was used to capture this event, the commissioned status at the time that the event was reported. Indicates whether the sensor is currently in a state where it should be reporting data. |
| `sensor_status_is_online` | Boolean | Optional | If a sensor was used to capture this event, the online status at the time that the event was reported. Indicates whether the sensor is currently online and reporting data. |
| `vehicle_id` | String | Optional | A vehicle identifier visible externally on the vehicle itself. If this field is needed for your use cases, review our [Privacy Guidance](/README.md#data-privacy). |
| `vehicle_license_plate` | String | Optional | The consistently placed vehicle license plate, usable by ALPR systems, when required for curb use. This field is potentially sensitive (depending on local, state, and national laws) and a data privacy framework is recommended for collecting, retention, deletion, obfuscation, and security. If this field is needed for your use cases, review our [Privacy Guidance](/README.md#data-privacy). |
| `vehicle_permit_number` | String | Optional | If applicable, the assigned permit number for this vehicle from the city agency. |
| `vehicle_length` | Integer | Conditionally Required | Approximate length of the vehicle that performed the event, in centimeters. Required for sources capable of determining vehicle length. |
| `vehicle_type` | [Vehicle Type](#vehicle-type) | Conditionally Required | Type of the vehicle that performed the event. Required for sources capable of determining vehicle type. |
| `vehicle_propulsion_types` | Array of [Propulsion Type](#propulsion-type) | Conditionally Required | List of propulsion types used by the vehicle that performed the event. Required for sources capable of determining vehicle propulsion type. |
| `vehicle_blocked_lane_types` | Array of [Lane Type](#lane-type) | Conditionally Required | Type(s) of lane blocked by the vehicle performing the event. If no lanes are blocked by the vehicle performing the event, the array should be empty.  Required for sources capable of determining it for the following event_types: _park_start_ |
| `curb_occupants` | Array of [Curb Occupant](#curb-occupants) | Conditionally Required | Current occupants of the Curb Zone. If the sensor is capable of identifying the linear location of the vehicle, then elements are sorted in ascending order according to the start property of the linear reference. Otherwise, elements appear in no particular order. Required for sources capable of determining it for the following event_types: _park_start, park_end, scheduled_report_ |
| `actual_cost` | Integer | Conditionally Required | If available from the source, the actual cost, in the currency defined in currency, paid by the curb user for this event. The currency type is sent in with the [REST Endpoints](#rest-endpoints) JSON object. All costs should be given as integers in the currency's smallest unit. As an example, to represent $1 USD, specify an amount of 100 (for 100 cents). |
| `payment_type` | [Payment Type](#payment-type) | Conditionally Required | If available from the source, the method used to pay for this event. |

### Vehicle Type

Type of vehicle `vehicle_type` similar to vehicle_type in MDS. For this CDS release the list will be developed independently here to accommodate CDS and MDS use cases, while still aligning to the MDS design principles.  In the next major MDS 2.0 release and next CDS release, alignment between CDS and MDS vehicle types can occur.

| Name             | Description |
|----------------- | ----------- |
| `bicycle`        | A two-wheeled mobility device intended for personal transportation that can be operated via pedals, with or without a motorized assist (includes e-bikes, recumbents, and tandems) |
| `cargo_bicycle`  | A two- or three-wheeled bicycle intended for transporting larger, heavier cargo than a standard bicycle (such as goods or passengers), with or without motorized assist (includes bakfiets/front-loaders, cargo trikes, and long-tails) |
| `car`            | A passenger car or similar light-duty vehicle |
| `scooter`        | A standing or seated fully-motorized mobility device intended for one rider, capable of travel at low or moderate speeds, and suited for operation in infrastructure shared with motorized bicycles |
| `moped`          | A seated fully-motorized mobility device capable of travel at moderate or high speeds and suited for operation in general urban traffic |

| `unspecified`    | Unspecified |

[Top][toc]

### Propulsion Type

Propulsion type `vehicle_propulsion_types` of the vehicle, similar to propulsion_type in MDS. For this CDS release the list will be developed independently here to accommodate CDS and MDS use cases, while still aligning to the MDS design principles.  In the next major MDS 2.0 release and next CDS release, alignment between CDS and MDS propulsion types can occur. 

| Name              | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `human`           | Pedal or foot propulsion                               |
| `electric_assist` | Provides power only alongside human propulsion         |
| `electric`        | Contains throttle mode with a battery-powered motor    |
| `combustion`      | Contains throttle mode with a gas engine-powered motor |

A vehicle may have one or more values from the `vehicle_propulsion_types`, depending on the number of modes of operation. For example, a scooter that can be powered by foot or by electric motor would have the `vehicle_propulsion_types` represented by the array `["human", "electric"]`. A bicycle with pedal-assist would have the `vehicle_propulsion_types` represented by the array `["human", "electric_assist"]` if it can also be operated as a traditional bicycle. A hybrid vehicle may use `["combustion", "electric"]`.
